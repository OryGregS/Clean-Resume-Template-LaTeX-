# Clean One-Page Resume Template
Modified version of the [Software Engineer Resume Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/resume-template-for-software-engineer/fvsqzcybnwdn) written by Xavier Danaux (xdanaux@gmail.com). 

Things I changed:
1. Added modifiable RGB-valued color to the fa-icons & turned the contact information into clickable links.
2. Changed margins to 1in on all sides.
3. Modified moderncv commands to add a thicker (1.5pt) horizontal line after each section.
4. Modified cv-entry commands to add a thinner (0.5pt) horizontal line after employment/education basic information.
5. Added command '\addcventryseparator' to separate different entries under the same section. See 'Education' as an example in the picture below.

## How to use
1. Download code as .zip folder & extract files
2. Open the [main.tex](https://github.com/OryGregS/Clean-Resume-Template-LaTeX-/blob/master/main.tex) file in a LaTeX editor of your choice & compile. I prefer to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) as it's a free cloud-based LaTeX editor. 
3. Edit with your personal info.
4. Happy hunting!

# Clean One-Page Resume Template
Modified version of the [Software Engineer Resume Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/resume-template-for-software-engineer/fvsqzcybnwdn) written by Xavier Danaux (xdanaux@gmail.com). 
## How to use
1. Download code as .zip folder & extract files
2. Open the [main.tex](https://github.com/OryGregS/Clean-Resume-Template-LaTeX-/blob/master/main.tex) file in a LaTeX editor of your choice & compile. I prefer to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) as it's a free cloud-based LaTeX editor. 
3. Edit with your personal info.
4. Happy hunting!
